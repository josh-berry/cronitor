# Each entry in this list is a rule describes a job, or set of jobs matched by
# shell-style wildcard.
#
# Rules are processed in order, so the first entry that matches a
# particular job name is used.  However, if a parameter (such as /errors/
# or /ignores/) takes a list of values, the lists from all rules matching a
# job will be concatenated.
#
# Each rule can have several parameters:
#
# "match" is a shell-style wildcard pattern.  Job names are tested against
# this pattern to see if the rule matches the job.
#
# "keep" is a duration -- we will keep logs from matching jobs for at least
# this long.
#
# "due_every" is a duration -- we expect matching jobs to run at least this
# frequently.  If a job has not reported in more than /due_every/
# minutes/hours/days/etc. after it last ran, the job is considered
# "overdue".
#
# Additionally, each rule has several lists of regexes, which are matched
# against lines from a job's output.
#
# Lines which match "errors" and "errors_i" regexes are considered errors.  If
# there are any such matches in a job's output, the entire job is considered
# to have failed.
#
# Lines which match "ignores" and "ignores_i" regexes are exceptions to the
# error regexes.  Even if a line matches an error regex, if it ALSO matches an
# ignore regex it will not be considered an error.
#
# The *_i variants of "errors" and "ignores" are case-insensitive.
